# Deepfence Cloud Scanner in AWS<br/>[ Example :: Organizational account setup ] - Deploy with member-account read-only access creation.

Deploy Deepfence cloud scanner for AWS in an Organizational setup. This approach involves deploying Deepfence cloud scanner in a single member account and creating a read only access role in all other member accounts for scanning. Jinja template, doit and bash script is used to automate creation of Terraform files for access creation in all member accounts. <br/>

Setup is as follows-
* In the **user-provided member account**
    * All the Deepfence cloud scanner service related resources/workload will be created

* In the **other member accounts**
    * A role will be created which will be assumed to perform scan.
     
### Notice
**Deployment cost** - This example will create resources that cost money.<br/>Run `terraform destroy` when you don't need them anymore

## Prerequisites

1. Organization's root account will be used to assume access in required member account for creating roles and to deploy the scanner in an ECS task. In each member account, there should be trust policy for -[`OrganizationAccountAccessRole`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_manage_accounts_access.html) role to be accessed by root account. Also, "assume policy" should be there in root account to assume role in member accounts.

     * When a member account is created within an organization, AWS will create an `OrganizationAccountAccessRole` [for account management](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_manage_accounts_access.html) in member account. 
     * However, when the account is invited into the organization, it's required to [create the role manually](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_manage_accounts_access.html#orgs_manage_accounts_create-cross-account-role)
       > You have to do this manually, as shown in the following procedure. This essentially duplicates the role automatically set up for created accounts. We recommend that you use the same name, OrganizationAccountAccessRole, for your manually created roles as same will be used to assume role in all member accounts.
2. Install awscli: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html#getting-started-install-instructions
3. Configure your AWS account using the command `aws configure` with a user with permissions as mentioned above.

## Usage

1. Create a folder in your local system. Download organizational deployment helper from the latest release.
```bash
# https://github.com/deepfence/terraform-aws-cloud-scanner/releases/latest
wget "https://github.com/deepfence/terraform-aws-cloud-scanner/releases/download/v0.9.0/organization_deployment_helper-v0.9.0-linux-amd64.tar.gz"
tar -xzf organization_deployment_helper-v0.9.0-linux-amd64.tar.gz
chmod +x organization_deployment_helper

wget "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/deepfence/terraform-aws-cloud-scanner/v0.9.0/examples/organizational-deploy-with-member-account-read-only-access-creation/member-account-access-creation-files/readonlyaccess.tf.j2"
wget "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/deepfence/terraform-aws-cloud-scanner/v0.9.0/examples/organizational-deploy-with-member-account-read-only-access-creation/member-account-access-creation-files/main.tf.j2"

./organization_deployment_helper
```

2. This will generate a main.tf terraform file with the following content.

```terraform
variable "name" {
  type        = string
  default     = "deepfence-cloud-scanner"
  description = "Name to be assigned to all child resources. A suffix may be added internally when required. Use default value unless you need to install multiple instances"
}

variable "tags" {
  type        = map(string)
  description = "Default tag for resource"
  default = {
    product = "deepfence-cloud-scanner"
  }
}

locals{
   CCS_member_account_id="<Member Account ID where Deepfence cloud scanner resources will be deployed> eg. XXXXXXXXXXXX"
}

provider "aws" {
   alias  = "member"
   region = "us-east-1"
   assume_role {
   # 'OrganizationAccountAccessRole' is the default role created by AWS for managed-account users to be able to admin member accounts.
   # <br/>https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_manage_accounts_access.html
    role_arn = "arn:aws:iam::${local.CCS_member_account_id}:role/OrganizationAccountAccessRole"
   }
}

module "cloud-scanner_example_organizational-deploy-with-member-account-read-only-access-creation" {
  providers = {
    aws.member = aws.member
  }
  source                        = "deepfence/cloud-scanner/aws//examples/organizational-deploy-with-member-account-read-only-access-creation"
  version                       = "0.9.1"
  name                          = var.name
  tags                          = var.tags
  # mgmt-console-url: deepfence.customer.com or 22.33.44.55
  mgmt-console-url              = "<Console URL>"
  mgmt-console-port             = "443"
  deepfence-key                 = "<Deepfence key>"
  # ThreatMapper
  image                         = "quay.io/deepfenceio/cloud_scanner_ce:2.5.1"
  # ThreatStryker
  # image                         = "quay.io/deepfenceio/cloud_scanner:2.5.1"
  # Disabled regions: List of cloud regions which should not be scanned
  # Example: ["us-east-1", "us-east-2"]
  enabled_cloud_regions         = []
  # Task CPU Units (Default: 8 vCPU)
  cpu                           = "8192"
  # Task Memory (Default: 16 GB)
  memory                        = "16384"
  # Task Ephemeral Storage (Default: 100 GB)
  ephemeral_storage             = "100"
  # Task role: Must be either arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/SecurityAudit or arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/ReadOnlyAccess
  task_role                     = "arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/SecurityAudit"
  # Log level - options: error, warn, info, debug, trace
  log_level                     = "info"
  deployed_account_id           = local.CCS_member_account_id
  # Use existing VPC (Optional)
  use_existing_vpc              = false
  # VPC ID (If use_existing_vpc is set to true)
  existing_vpc_id               = ""
  # List of VPC Subnet IDs (If use_existing_vpc is set to true)
  existing_vpc_subnet_ids       = []
  # Optional: To refresh the cloud resources every hour, provide CloudTrail Trail ARNs (Management events with write-only or read-write).
  # If empty, a trail with management events will be automatically chosen if available.
  # e.g.: ["arn:aws:cloudtrail:us-east-1:123456789012:trail/aws-events"]
  enable_cloudtrail_trails      = true
  cloudtrail_trails             = []
}
```

3. This Terraform module creates read only role in each member account and deploys deepfence-cloud-scanner ECS task in one of the selected member account.       

4. Run Terraform commands to create the resources. To run this example you need have your [aws management-account profile configured in CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-profiles.html) and to execute:
```bash
terraform init
terraform plan
terraform apply
```

See inputs summary for more optional configuration.
